## Stakeholders

stakeholder interviewee: Na Li (she/her)-- owner of a florist store. 

Her goals and problems: 
goal#1: The stakeholder wants to have a good demonstration of each kind of product for her customers. 
goal#2: The stakeholder wants to make customers able to leave comments and ratings after making a purchase. 
goal#3: The stakeholder wants there to be be seasonal products being sold at different times of the year 
goal#4: The stakeholder wants the app to be able to offer recommendations according to the user’s requirements and prefrences. 

problem#1: Sometimes the customers take unexpected long wait for delivery, they demand an estimation of delivery time/pick up time (better if can track activity)
problem#2: Sometimes a product is sold out but the store kept receiving orders -- the store manager should be able to update cart/stock info.  
problem#3: A customer may want to diy their own flower bouquet, but they are having truble as non-experts. It's helpful if we can connect a customer to a florist to create their own design. 
problem#4: Sometimes customers have a hard time staying on top of store events, discounts and promotions.
